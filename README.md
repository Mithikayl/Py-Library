# Py-Library

Py-Library is a project dedicated to making small programs to better my own python experience and improve my ability. It focuses on making small, everyday and efficient programs that enable me to learn new things and refine my skills. Feel free to let me know how I can improve any scripts here to make them more efficient, clean and refined.

### Goals during project:

- make something pertaining to data analysis
- work with inputted files
- image manipulation
- a big controller, making every file accessible from a central one
- something to do with web development
- cryptography
